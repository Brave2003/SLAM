# SLAM Algorithm Development Repository

Welcome to the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) Algorithm Development Repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting the process of developing SLAM algorithms.

## Overview

SLAM is a crucial problem in robotics, enabling robots or devices to map unknown environments while localizing themselves within those environments. This repository serves as a platform to track the progress and iterations of developing SLAM algorithms.

## Goals

The primary objectives of this repository are:

- To document the process of developing SLAM algorithms.
- To share insights, code, and resources related to SLAM.
- To foster collaboration and discussion among researchers and enthusiasts interested in SLAM.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/app**: Contains application code for running SLAM algorithms or related utilities.
- **/include**: Header files for reusable components and interfaces.
- **/cmake_modules**: CMake modules for building the project.
- **/config**: Configuration files for parameters and settings.
- **/src**: Source code for implementing SLAM algorithms and related functionalities.
- **/test**: Test suites for verifying the correctness and performance of the algorithms.

## Getting Started

If you're new to SLAM or this repository, here's how you can get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the directories and familiarize yourself with the contents.
3. Check the documentation in the `/docs` directory for insights into the algorithms and their implementations.
4. Experiment with the provided examples in the `/examples` directory.
5. Join discussions and contribute to the development by opening issues or pull requests.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have ideas for improving existing algorithms, adding new features, or fixing bugs, feel free to contribute. Please follow these guidelines:

- Open an issue to discuss major changes or enhancements before submitting a pull request.
- Ensure that your code follows the repository's coding style and conventions.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Test your changes thoroughly and provide documentation and examples where necessary.
